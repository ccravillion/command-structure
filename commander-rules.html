    <h1>How to make a Commander Deck</h1>
    <p>In order to play a game of Commander you are going to need a Commander deck.  A Commander deck will consist of
    99 cards plus 1 Commander card.  Commander cards are creatures that are classified as Legendary creatures.  When you
    are building your deck it is important to know what your Commander does and what their color identity is.  The cards you
    choose to add into the deck need to match the colors of mana your Commander uses, and they need to synergize with
    what your Commander does.  Say your Commander can give your creatures +1/+1 counters to increase their hitting power and
    health, you could pair that with cards that can do specific things when a creature gets a +1/+1 counter like creatures can
    now fly or have lifelink.</p>

    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <p>Now that you have a Commander deck ready to play with Let's go over how to play a game of Commander!  At the start of the game,
    you and each player in your group starts shuffling their decks to randomize the cards they will get.  It is recommended to ask another
    player in your group to "cut" or split your deck.  This is to reduce the chance of cheating and promote fairness for the game.
    Once you and your opponents are finished shuffling your cards, everyone will grab 7 cards from the top of their library of cards.
    This is going to be the hand that you start the game with.  </p>
